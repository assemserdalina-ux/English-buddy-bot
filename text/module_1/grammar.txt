📘 Passive Voice: When to Use It

We use the passive when:

🔹 🙈 We don’t know or don’t care who does the action

✅ The technology club was first organised in 1995.
(We don’t say who organised it.)

🧑‍🎨 Use by + person/agent:

The sculpture was made by Sanzhar.

🔨 Use with + tool/material:

The sculpture is made with wood.

🔹 ⭐ The action is more important than the person doing it

✅ Recycled materials are transformed into art in this club.

(The process is more important than the people.)

🔹 🎩 To sound formal or polite

✅ Paintballing without a helmet is prohibited.
(This is more polite and official than saying “You can’t play without a helmet.”)
